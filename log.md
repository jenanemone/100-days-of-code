# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 24th, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- I completed a 6kyu Kata (Mexican Wave) on CodeWars: [link to kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58f5c63f1e26ecda7e000029)
- I created WebDev Trivial Pursuit game board options. 
- I worked on My Favorite Monsters CRUD app. 

**Thoughts:** 
I really need a better handle on how server.js and main.js communicate for UPDATE & DELETE methods.
